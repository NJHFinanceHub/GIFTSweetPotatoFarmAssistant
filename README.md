Sweet Potato Farmer's Plan 🍠

This is a single-file, all-in-one HTML web application designed to help farmers and gardeners plan, track, and manage the sweet potato propagation and growing process.

It combines a step-by-step guide with dynamic planning tools and a project log.

✨ Features

Step-by-Step Guide: An 11-phase guide covering the entire process from sprouting the mother potato to harvesting and selling.

Dynamic Crop Planner: Allows you to input your target "Planting Date" and automatically calculates all key prerequisite dates (like when to start the mother potato) and post-planting milestones (like harvest and curing).

Customizable Assumptions: You can adjust the default timeframes (e.g., "Days to Harvest," "Days for Sprouting") to match your specific geography and sweet potato variety.

Google Calendar Integration:

Add individual events from the planner directly to your Google Calendar.

Add all calculated events to your calendar in one click.

Project Log: A persistent log to track:

Key metrics like Soil pH, number of slips cut, and pest sightings.
